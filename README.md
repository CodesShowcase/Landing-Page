# Landing Page Project

## Foreword

This whole project was really ridiculous, since sometimes the use of additional libraries like jQuery and Bootstrap is encouraged and other times it is not allowed, but never clearly stated.
And also this time the reaction was very slow, it took a almost a week for the guys to just show a simple reaction after a few complaints...

## Documentation

A fourth section was added to the three section starting project. For this the third section was copied in index.html and adjustments were made, that it is now section four.

In addition some minor tweeks were made to the styles.css file. Now e.g. the active section (visible section) is highlighted.

Major changes/additions were made to the Javascript. There is a dynamic navbar which automatically detects all sections and update the navbar. Also the active (visible) section will be highlighted and a ScrollToTopButton was implemented. As an additional feature the navbar will autohide if there is no scrolling activity.
